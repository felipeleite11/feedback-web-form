This project implements a feedback form for web solutions. The user can take screenshots and write a text before send your feedback. 

Step 1 - The user choose a feedback type, as bug, ideia or other.

Step 2 - The second step is a text with more details about the chosen item on step 1.

Step 3 - The third step is a success message.

Just do the integration with an API and insert in your web system.
